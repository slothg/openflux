# Help Us Help You #

OpenFlux is supported solely by Flex and Flash developers such as yourself, and we want to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute. One of the best ways you can help is to try OpenFlux and provide feedback in the form of bug reports or code reviews. A few blog posts with awesome OpenFlux demos wouldn't hurt either :-). When you're ready, there are a few more formal options that you can consider.


## Community Contributors ##

Community Contributors are usually OpenFlux users who have come across bugs or developed features which aren't in the core project yet. Becoming an OpenFlux Contributor doesn't require a long-term commitment, plus there's no messy break-up at the end. If you submit a bug or feature request with a patch and that patch is accepted, you're a contributor. Congratulations! We'll make sure you get credit where credit's due.

## Peer Contributors ##

Peer Contributors are usually developing extensions of OpenFlux that may be out of scope for the core framework but still require a level of collaboration and support from the core team. To become a Peer Contributor, contact a core team member or send a message to the mailing list describing the project you have in mind. We can provide you with a public svn branch of OpenFlux for your own development, and support your efforts with core improvements and project feedback where required.

## Core Team Contributors ##

Core Contributors are responsible for the majority of development in OpenFlux and collaborate on the roadmap and goals of the project. Becoming a core team member is a little bit like common-law marriage, we just kind of assume you're on the team after you've submitted enough awesome new code or spent enough late nights working for free.
